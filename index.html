  <title>Ticket Service API</title>
  <body>
    <p>
      When you buy a ticket, the web site retrieves the ticket's codes from ABUS and ATRAM, and asks the Ticket Service to create a new ticket:
      <pre>
        PUT /ticket/:abus_code/:atram_code
      </pre>
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the site can show you the ticket as a PNG barcode:
      <pre>
        GET /ticket/:abus_code/:atram_code
      </pre>
      Example: <a href="/ticket/abcd/1234">/ticket/abcd/1234</a>
    </p>    
    <p>
      Open the ticket on your smartphone and pass it on a vehicle's checking machine to check in:
      <pre>
        PUT /check_ins/:abus_code/:atram_code/
        returns: 200 for OK. [What about expired/unknown tickets?]
      </pre>
    </p>    
    <p>
      Do the same to check out:
      <pre>
        PUT /check_outs/:abus_code/:atram_code/
        returns: 200 for OK. [What about expired/unknown tickets?]
      </pre>
    </p>
